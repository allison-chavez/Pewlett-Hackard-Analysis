# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Analysis Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to take the company staff data provided by Pewlett-Hackard to create a database that demonstrates employee trends within the company. More specifically, to establish the number of retiring employees by title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on different attributes from the data.

 ## Results: 
- Unique titles file allows HR to have clean data to see the retirement eligible employees current title instead of all their previous titles so they can better prepare for job openings.
- There are only 2 managers within the company, compared to how many people are currently employed this ratio is not sustainable for the company.

- PH has 1549 employees who are eligible to be a part of the mentorship program.

# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Analysis Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to take the company staff data provided by Pewlett-Hackard to create a database that demonstrates employee trends within the company. More specifically, to establish the number of retiring employees by title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on different attributes from the data.

 ## Results: 
- Unique titles file allows HR to have clean data to see the retirement eligible employees current title instead of all their previous titles so they can better prepare for job openings.
- There are only 2 managers within the company, compared to how many people are currently employed this ratio is not sustainable for the company.

- PH has a total of 90398 employees who are about to or eligible to retire.

- PH has 1549 employees who are eligible to be a part of the mentorship program. 





## Summary
Pewlett-Hackard has 90398 employees who are eligible for retirement according to the retiring by title analysis. There are a total of 1549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program that can facilitate the "silver tsunami" within the company. The data generated through this analysis can help support and reinforce the need for a mentorship program, therefore the company is not at a loss and can properly prepare current non-eligible retirement employees for promotions. The data also provides concise information of what departments and titles are most in demand and would face higher loss if not properly prepared due to retirement. New hires can be sought out more precisely and be adequately trained for their role in the company.

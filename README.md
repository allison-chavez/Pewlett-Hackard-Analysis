# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Analysis Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to take the company staff data provided by Pewlett-Hackard to create a database that demonstrates employee trends within the company. More specifically, to establish the number of retiring employees by title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on different attributes from the data.

 ## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
